## Websites I Recommend

[TELEGRAM](https://web.telegram.org/)
- **TELEGRAM** is a communication website that has an app to go with it. You can add new private group chat channels
as well as join existing chat channels.

be difficult for beginners but once it's understood it is preferred by many. **DISCORD** can be expensive depending on the options you choose to purchase.
